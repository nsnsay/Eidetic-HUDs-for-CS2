# radars

* Radars in `ingame-legacy` are from CS:GO. They are kept because it was easy to keep them alive so far, but they may not be part of this app forever.
* Radars in `ingame` are extracted from the CS2 game files.
* Radaras in `ingame-transparent` are extracted from the CS2 game files, and were then edited to have a transparent background.
* Radars in `simpleradar` are from the CS:GO edition of [Simple Radar](https://readtldr.gg/simpleradar).
